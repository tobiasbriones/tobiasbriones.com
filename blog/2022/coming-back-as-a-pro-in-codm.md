# Coming Back as Pro in CODM

After several months without having enough focus to play (one to two months), I
got a CODM notification. I don't like annoying notifications going off on my
phone, so I opened it up, to play some matches instead :>.

After having played Drop Zone before, I encountered a new game UI, and new maps
like Miami.

I love Miami (in video games) as that reminds me of Gangstar 2: Miami
Vindication. So, I started playing Hardpoint on this map.

I usually like Hardpoint as it allows me to get more scorestreaks, and I've been
extremely crazy about military support as I was a lifetime fan of Modern Combat.

## Miami

The first thing I got was a VTOL from a package drop, the map is fascinating for
me as I said. Hardpoint is not a good fit for these kinds of maps but is still
tactical. I have to say, I've been crazy about Shipment because it is a closed
map, and it gets crazy when playing Hardpoint with VTOLS, it is also a Zula map
-a mediocre CS: GO copy and a free PC game that I've also played a lot-.

## That's not It

And, suddenly (I didn't expect), I got a Nuke. Deploy Nuke on Miami:

I had two matches, and I was able to show off my superior skills pretty
straightforwardly.

Do you think they're bots when the game is easy? I don't think so. Top players
usually have iPads or gaming phones with accessories, I don't have any of those,
but I'm skilfully enough to get by as a PRO.

Back in the day, I just had a low-end phone or tablet, I was not able to play
well at all because of lag. I still played quite well. Now I'm a veteran that
has a flagship, and four fingers to deploy ay operations against anyone facing
me online.

After some gap, while being off the game, this was a great welcome back.

## Number One as Always

I'm the GMPN1 since inception. I score at the top most of the time.

This is the first personal blog entry I write, so I was really excited.
